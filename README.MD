# SearchEngTestApplicationJava Engineer Test Task## Simplicity Assumptions made* Documents key are integers* Documents text consists ASCII symbols ONLY* Documents are relatively small means splitting/chunk processing and related approaches are out of scope* Total number of words that can be used in document is limited(f.i up to 100K) so can be easily allocated in RAM* Number of documents is limited(f.i less than 100K)* Tokenization is primitive and works for ASCII texts only. No special word identification algorithms* No in memory DB is used so transaction is not supported## Steps to run backendBuild project with MAVEN```mvn clean install```Run executable search-eng-app-1.0-SNAPSHOT-exec.jar that could found in /PROJECT_ROOT/search-eng-app/target folder```java -jar search-eng-app-1.0-SNAPSHOT-exec.jar```## Steps to run client### Web UI(SWAGGER)Start backend then open http://{HOST}:8080/swagger-ui.html to open SWAGGER UI. It is quite ituitive so no description here### Command client line with CURLSample command are####Add document ID:1 TEXT:TEST BODY```curl -X POST --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --header 'Accept: application/json' -d '{ \   "id": 1, \   "text": "TEST BODY" \ }' 'http://localhost:8080/api/v1/documents/'```####Get document ID:1```curl -X GET --header 'Accept: application/json' 'http://localhost:8080/api/v1/documents/1'####Get document IDs containing 'TEST BODY' token string```curl -X POST --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --header 'Accept: application/json' -d 'TEST BODY' 'http://localhost:8080/api/v1/documents/list'```
